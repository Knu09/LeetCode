## 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III


Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.


Example 1:

    Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
    Output: 6
    Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
    Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

Example 2:

    Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
    Output: 10
    Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
